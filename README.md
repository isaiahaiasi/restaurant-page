# "Restaurant Page" Odin project
This project involved making a Single Page App using ES modules, Webpack, and vanilla JS.

I chose to theme this as a sort of ad for a team of adventurers from Dungeons & Dragons.

The dragon logo was made by myself, which was fun. The overall aesthetic is very minimal, because this project is just meant to be a stepping stone between "touching Webpack for the first time" and "making a big project with it."
